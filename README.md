# BuddyPairer
A simple python script that creates randomised pairings of elements from an input list. So for example the input 
list:

A
B
C
D

Might be paired as:

A -> D

B -> C

C -> A

D -> B

Elements are guaranteed not to be paired with either themselves of with a reciprocal relationship ( A -> B and B -> A).

The intention of this script was originally to put people randomly in contact with one another, so given a list of names,
the script can create a list of informal random introductions between people.
